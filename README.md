# react-minimal-app

Build a simple, minimal app in order to learn and better fix React knowledge.
Followed courses from YouTube channel **The Net Ninja**, playlist **Full Modern React Tutorial**.

Commands to run the project: <br />
**npm run start** -> Start the app <br />
**npx json-server --watch db/db.json --port {number}** -> Start Json Server (to have a form of "persistent" data)
